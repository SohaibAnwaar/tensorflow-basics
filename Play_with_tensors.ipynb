    "This notebook includes some basic functionality of tensors which really helps a data-scientist/machine-learning engineer to build a model. Special thing about this notebook is, it is made for begineers. Most of my fresh grad friends want to be a data-scientist/machine learning engineer, as I am also in learning phase so I decided to write down things, notes or things which helps me and my juniors to climb ladder of success. So lets gets started\n",
